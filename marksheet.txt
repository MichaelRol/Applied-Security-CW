1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : [40] hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited 
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party 
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work 
and what isn't:

[I made use of the board specific read function Dan Page posted on the forum
 under the thread "FAQs: lab. worksheets 1.1 and 1.2"
 
 Also used str2octetstr( x ) and seq2str( x ) functions from lab-1-1.]

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious aspect (e.g., functional correctness); other aspects
outside this list can warrant an increase/decrease in marks, with examples
including hard to quantify features such as style, efficiency, robustness, 
generality, or realism of a solution.  Put another way, identifying then
reasoning about these latter aspects forms part of the assessment, so they
are not (necessarily) detailed explicitly.

[X] Stage 1 : a  attack target  implementation                       ( 30%)

    Stage 2 : an attack         implementation
[X]           - an   assisted (or   dependent) solution              ( 30%)
                *OR*
[?]           - an unassisted (or independent) solution              ( 40%)

[?] Stage 3 : a  countermeasure implementation                       ( 30%)

                                                                     ------
                                                                     (100%)

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

[
    Stage 1: To run my target.c on the board simply follow the instructions for
    uploading a program to the board described in the first worksheet and 
    assignment and then enter the input into the terminal as describe at the 
    bottom of the assignment description. A makefile has been included in the
    board folder where you can use make build-project to build the project and
    make program-target to initate the programming of the board.

    Stage 2: To run my attact use command:

        python attack.py "traces.dat"

    The file traces.dat has been included in the upload.
